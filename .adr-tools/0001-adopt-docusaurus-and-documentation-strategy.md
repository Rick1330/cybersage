# 1. Adopt Docusaurus and Define Initial Documentation Strategy

*   **Date:** 2025-05-22
*   **Status:** Accepted

## Context

The CyberSage project has a comprehensive structure but lacks consistent and detailed documentation. Existing documentation efforts show remnants of MkDocs (`mkdocs.yml`) and an active but sparsely populated Docusaurus (`docusaurus.config.js`, `docs/src/`) setup. Key architectural documents, a detailed security model, and consistent component-level documentation are missing. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file mentions documentation responsibilities but lacks specific guidance on tooling and structure.

## Decision

1.  **Docusaurus as Primary Tool:** CyberSage will officially adopt Docusaurus as the sole static site generator for its technical documentation. All MkDocs-related files and configurations will be removed to avoid confusion.
2.  **Defined Information Architecture:** The documentation site hosted in `/docs` (built from `/docs/src`) will be structured with the following top-level sections: Introduction, Architecture, Security, Developer Guide, User Guide, API Reference, Operations Guide, and Contributing. This structure will be reflected in `docs/sidebars.js`.
3.  **Component Documentation Standard:** A standard for component documentation will be adopted, based on the existing detailed examples in `core/agent_manager.md` and `core/chain_builder.md`. A template (`docs/src/templates/COMPONENT_TEMPLATE.md`) will be provided.
4.  **ADR Process Introduction:** This ADR marks the beginning of using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural choices. ADRs will be stored in the `.adr-tools/` directory.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Clear and unified documentation toolchain.
    *   Improved discoverability and organization of documentation.
    *   Standardized format for component documentation, improving quality and consistency.
    *   Formalized process for recording key architectural decisions.
    *   `CONTRIBUTING.md` will be updated to reflect these decisions, guiding developers.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Initial effort required to create missing documentation and convert any valuable, unstructured existing notes.
    *   Developers will need to familiarize themselves with Docusaurus and the new documentation standards.
